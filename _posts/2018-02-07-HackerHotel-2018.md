title: HackerHotel 2018 <br />( 16 Februari - 18 Februari )
---

After 2 previous editions, HackerHotel will be back again in 2018. This year Pixelbar will join this awesome hacking/security conference with around 10 participants.

HackerHotel is an event which not only hosts technical and informational talks, but there will also be some space to hack around a bit with led panels, arduino's, lockpinging, soldering, programming,... you name it.

One of our members (Miep) is even having a talk about decryption of ssl traffic. You could say, Pixelbar is surely to be found at the event! 

Will we see you there? We'll bring stickers!
