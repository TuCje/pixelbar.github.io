Happy Sint Pannekoek everybody! We're celebrating this very nice tradition at the space **today** starting **at 19:00**, with lots and lots of pancakes and friends! Please let us know if you'd like to join on to our [Slack](https://slack.pixelbar.nl) or IRC.

Wait. You've never heard of Sint Pannekoek before? Well, it's a very old Rotterdam tradition and we'd like to celebrate it by basically eating lots of pancakes. Yep. It's the best tradition there is. And nobody will ever change our tradition.
