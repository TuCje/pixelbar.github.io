title: Announcing Electron Junction @ Pixelbar
---

We're happy to announce [Electron Junction](https://electronjunction.nl). An event that is all about people that like to tinker and play around with electronics, which can be as simple as blinking a LED with an Arduino or as complicated as building autonomous robots to explore the universe. While the focus will be on hardware, software will play an important role as well.

[//]: #Tickets are available at our ticket shop via our website [Electron Junction](https://electronjunction.nl). If you want to participate in the Arduino workshop by Mitch Altman or the SMD workshop by Klimnt you can reserve your spot and reserve the required kits of components in the shop as well. Please note, there are limited component kits.
