title: Announcing NodeSchool Rotterdam
---

![logo](http://nodeschool.io/images/schoolhouse.svg)

We're hosting the first NodeSchool in Rotterdam. [NodeSchool](http://nodeschool.io/) are hosted open source workshops that teach web software skills. And best of all... they're free. 

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is a popular, open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment for developing a diverse variety of tools and applications. This first edition will be focussing on the basics of [JavaScript (ES6)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) with Node.

Let's see whether people in Rotterdam are interested to learn writing software. 

We're planning to organise this every month. The first edition is already full, but when you signup on meetup.com, you'll be notified when the next one is announced.
